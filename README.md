# qk

**qk**, short for **quick**, is a standalone task runner written in Rust.
It starts with Nx-compatible workspace configuration and will grow into task
execution, affected selection, caching and run history.

The first implementation supports **workspace inspection**. Task execution,
lockfile analysis and caching are not implemented yet. The
[design](docs/task-runner-design.md) describes the longer-term plan, not the
current feature set.

## Try it

Install a current stable Rust toolchain, then run from this repository:

```sh
cargo run -p qk-cli -- --workspace examples/basic show projects
cargo run -p qk-cli -- --workspace examples/basic show project web --json
cargo run -p qk-cli -- --workspace examples/basic show projects --projects 'tag:scope:*' --json
cargo run -p qk-cli -- --workspace examples/basic graph --file -
```

The example is self-contained; no Node installation, package installation,
Nx process is required. Its commands are
configuration examples only and are not executed.

To install the binary locally:

```sh
cargo install --path crates/qk-cli --locked
qk --help
qk --workspace /path/to/your/workspace show projects --json
```

Inside a workspace, omit `--workspace`. qk searches ancestors for `nx.json`,
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` or a root `package.json` with `workspaces`. A standalone
`project.json`, or a package with an `nx` object, is also supported when no
parent workspace marker exists.

## Current commands

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `qk show projects [--json]` | Sorted project names, one per line or as a JSON array |
| `qk show projects -p 'web,tag:library' --exclude 'experimental-*'` | Union of matching names, globs and tags, minus exclusions |
| `qk show project <name> [--json]` | Normalized project configuration as JSON |
| `qk graph --file <path>` | Workspace project graph in a `{ "graph": { "nodes": ..., "dependencies": ... } }` envelope |
| `qk graph` or `qk graph --file -` | The same graph on stdout |

`--workspace <path>` works before or after the subcommand. Graph output paths
are relative to the invocation directory; their parent directories must
already exist. JSON output has no progress messages mixed into stdout.
Errors go to stderr and return a nonzero exit code. Unknown commands and
flags, including `run` and `--affected`, fail explicitly.

Project selectors support `*`, `?`, character classes and `tag:<glob>`.
Repeat `--projects` or use commas to combine selectors. Prefix a selector
with `!` to exclude it; exclusions win regardless of order. With only
exclusions, selection starts with all projects. A selector matching nothing
returns an empty list; `show project` requires an existing exact name.
Quote globs so the shell does not expand them. Commas delimit CLI selectors,
so brace globs containing commas are not supported on the command line.

## Configuration and graph support

- Reads JSON with comments, trailing commas and `"//"` comment keys.
- Discovers `project.json` files, including nested projects, and package
  manifests selected by pnpm workspace globs or `package.json` workspaces.
  pnpm patterns take precedence when both are present. Exclusion globs win.
  An explicit `project.json` remains a project even outside package globs.
- Includes a root package as a project when it has an `nx` object or an
  adjacent `project.json`. Package scripts become `nx:run-script` targets;
  `includedScripts` supplies that set, including an empty array to disable it.
  Listed names need not exist in `scripts`: they initially declare script
  targets, which explicit targets in package `nx` configuration or
  `project.json` can override. Script existence is not validated during inspection.
- Merges package `nx` configuration with adjacent `project.json`, with the
  latter taking precedence. Explicit project names win over package names;
  projects without either use their relative directory with `/` replaced by
  `-`. Duplicate names fail with both project roots in the error.
- Applies exact executor-keyed or target-name-keyed `targetDefaults`.
  Executor defaults take precedence. Options merge by key; each named
  configuration merges by key; nested values and arrays are replaced.
  Project-level named inputs override workspace definitions by name.
- Normalizes a target's `command` shorthand into `nx:run-commands` options.
  Changing an executor drops options and configurations from the previous
  executor. Inspection preserves other executor names and unknown metadata.
- Builds workspace edges from the four dependency sections in package
  manifests, matching declared dependency names to workspace package names.
  Adds `implicitDependencies` selected by names, globs or tags; negations
  remove matching edges. Unknown exact implicit dependencies are errors.
- Emits sorted project nodes and deduplicated dependency edges, with portable
  workspace-relative paths. Cycles are allowed in the project graph; reverse
  dependency traversal terminates even when cycles exist.

Discovery respects workspace ignore files, skips symlink directories and
excludes `node_modules`, `.git`, `.nx`, `.qk`, `.pnpm-store`, and the root
Cargo `target` directory. Parent and global Git ignore rules do not affect
discovery. Hidden project directories otherwise remain discoverable.

This is a subset of the design's compatibility surface. There is no Nx
parity claim yet. In particular:

- The graph includes **workspace projects only**. External dependencies,
  lockfile versions, workspace dependency aliases and version-range resolution
  await the lockfile layer. Name matching is currently conservative.
- Target-default glob keys and filtered defaults are not implemented;
  filtered default arrays are rejected. Nx plugins and inferred targets are
  outside the design's scope.
- Input expressions, task dependencies and configurations are preserved for
  inspection; their execution semantics are not resolved yet. `.env` files
  and runtime inputs are not evaluated.
- `affected`, task scheduling, cache storage, remote storage, history,
  release commands and npm binary distribution remain future work.

The compatibility baseline is documented in Nx's
[project configuration](https://nx.dev/docs/reference/project-configuration)
and [workspace configuration](https://nx.dev/docs/reference/nx-json)
references. The bounded subset above and fixture tests define qk's current
behavior; new Nx features are not automatically supported.

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo build --release --locked
```

The Cargo workspace contains three crates:

| Crate | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `qk-config` | Workspace discovery, JSONC/YAML parsing, typed project configuration and normalization |
| `qk-graph` | Workspace edges, project selection, reverse reachability and graph export |
| `qk-cli` | Argument parsing and output; produces the `qk` binary |

Fixture and CLI tests use self-contained workspaces. GitHub Actions is
configured for Linux, macOS and Windows. The lockfile is checked in for
reproducible dependency resolution.

Next: add pnpm v9 lockfile parsing and external graph nodes, then capture Nx
parity fixtures before implementing affected selection and task execution.
